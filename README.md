# HousePricePrediction
This repository contains a Python script for predicting house prices using linear regression. The script utilizes various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to handle data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

Features:

Data Loading: The script loads a dataset from a CSV file containing information about house attributes like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, etc.

Preprocessing: Non-numeric columns are excluded, and relevant features and the target variable (house prices) are selected for analysis.

Model Training: A linear regression model is built and trained using the selected features and target variable.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess its performance.

Predictions and Visualization: The script makes predictions on a test set and visualizes the actual versus predicted house prices using a scatter plot.

New Data Prediction: It also provides functionality to predict house prices based on new input data.
